// The house style is a copy of rijdho/house-style, never a fork. Two checks:
//  1. the copy matches its lock: always runs, so an edit to src/house/house.css fails in CI;
//  2. the lock matches the original: runs when a checkout sits next to this repository, so a copy
//     that has fallen behind fails locally. When it is absent the test says so, it does not pass quietly.
